             and he also has to find time for himself. With all of that, he doesn't have time to plan a healthy diet.

          <p>
             The first set of sketches showcases what the daily overview might look like including the meals planned for that day, a section where you can learn more about the meals you have planned, and even a section where certain meals
             are suggested for you based on your previous meal plans. The second sketch displays what the welcome interface may look like, it will then prompt the user to include some info about themselves including their name, and the final 
             part of that sketch informs the user of how their data will be used while also letting them know that they're in control of how it is going to be used.

     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkfrZRzMfS0"><h2>Team Paper Prototype: Plan N' Plate</h2></a>
        <p>
         The prototype starts off with the option to input your personal information to help tailor the app to better suit you. After inputting your information or skipping that step, you will create your first meal plan.
         After creating your own meal plan, you can inspect it further, customize the time, and even pick from existing presets or create more presets for the specific meal of the day. After confirming your plan, you can then 
         view an overview of your plan. You are then taken back to the main menu where you can review the plan you selected and learn more about the nutritional values of your meals. In the review page, you can also adjust specific
         meals and the times at which those meals are scheduled.
