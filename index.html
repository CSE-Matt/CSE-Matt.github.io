             and he also has to find time for himself. With all of that, he doesn't have time to plan a healthy diet.

        <p>
         The prototype starts off with the option to input your personal information to help tailor the app to better suit you. After inputting your information or skipping that step, you will create your first meal plan.
         After creating your own meal plan, you can inspect it further, customize the time, and even pick from existing presets or create more presets for the specific meal of the day. After confirming your plan, you can then 
         view an overview of your plan. You are then taken back to the main menu where you can review the plan you selected and learn more about the nutritional values of your meals. In the review page, you can also adjust specific
         meals and the times at which those meals are scheduled.
